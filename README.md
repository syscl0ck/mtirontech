# Dead Byte Systems

This repository contains a Next.js template inspired by **Dead Space 2**. It features a dark sci-fi theme with frightening computer imagery and flickering text effects. Use it as a starting point to build your own horror-themed landing page.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the `tech-landing-page` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Feel free to adapt the content and animations to create your own spooky site.
