excerpt: 'This post is rendered from a local Markdown file, but the same principles apply to fetching content from a headless CMS.'

The structure of this blog is a great example of a core concept in modern web development: **decoupling the content from the presentation**.

Right now, our content lives in local `.md` files inside the `posts/` directory. Our Next.js application reads these files at build time and generates static HTML pages.

### The Next Step: Headless CMS

The next logical step for many applications is to move this content into a **Headless CMS** like Strapi, Contentful, or Sanity.io.

By doing this, non-technical team members can easily write, edit, and manage blog posts without ever needing to touch the codebase. The `lib/posts.js` file would be modified to fetch data from the CMS API instead of the local filesystem.
